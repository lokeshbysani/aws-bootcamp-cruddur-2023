### Logical Design
I created the Logical design using Lucid chart for the crudder app.Thank you for your Youtube video for this. It provided more clarity. I provided the basic version now. 
```
To not have any downtime for the application we are developing I will be adding availability Zones concept so that app will be available if one if the aws resgion is down. I am working on it wil provide the updated design shortly. 
```
